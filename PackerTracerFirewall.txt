Using Firewall Rules - 
    1. 4 system topology - 3 PCs (1.0.0.1 - 1.0.0.3) and one server (Web server, 1.0.0.4); all connected by a switch
    2. Access server, then go to Firewall, then proceed to do this:
            Deny -> ICMP -> Remote IP: 0.0.0.0 -> Wildcard Mask: 255.255.255.255
            Allow -> IP -> Remote IP: 0.0.0.0 -> Wildcard Mask: 255.255.255.255
        Save the settings
    3. Now ping the server, it will not respond. Access to the server's webpage will work.

Using ACLs - 
    1. Create a topology like this: 
        4 PCs (10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.4) --> Switch <----> (10.0.0.5) Router (11.0.1.2) <----> Server (11.0.1.1)
        Set defualt gateways for PCs and Server properly as defined
    2. Open the CLI of the router and enter these commands
            access-list 20 deny 10.0.0.1
            access-list 20 permit 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255
            interface g0/0/0 (router interface facing the PCs)
            ip access-group 20 in
            exit
    3. PC with IP 10.0.0.1 must be denied any access through router, but other PCs can access.
