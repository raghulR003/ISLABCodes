Snort
1. Run if config and note down the inet addr of enp0s3 or eth0.

Steps in ubuntu:
1. sudo apt-get install snort
2. cd /etc/snort/rules
3. sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf (if you want, add -i enps03/eth0 as per specifications) - This is the testing guy.
4. sudo snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf - Try pinging the ip address from Windows CMD
   Also try this command: sudo snort -A console -q -u snort -g snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i enp0s3 
5. For the last command in 4, try nmap <ip_addr> for simulating attack.

For setting up local rules:
0. Make changes to the snort.conf by entering "sudo cat \etc\snort\snort.conf" (make changes to HOME NET variable)
1. sudo cat /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
2. Detect any ICMP pings - alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP Ping detected!!!"; sid:100001; rev:1;) - add the previous line.
3. In terminal run: sudo snort -q -l /var/log/snort -i enp0s3 -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf and type enter.
4. To test if this is working - and perform a ping to the local net address of enps03 (try Windows CMD/Kali)
